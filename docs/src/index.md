# Introduction

This project is an Apache Guacamole plugin and a middleware which aims to achieve the following tasks:

1. Provide a GUI element in Apache Guacamole which allows you to invoke the creation of a predefined Terraform VM.
1. Automatically add the newly created Terraform VM to the user's Apache Guacamole GUI.

## Project Name

The name "Invocado" is a play on the words Invoke and Avocado.
I thought this was fitting since it is used to invoke the creation of VMs and make Guacamole out of the ingredients in your Terraform config.
